  <h1> Numb</h1>
  <h2> Linkin Park</h2>
  <p>
    I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface <br>
I don't know what you're expecting of me <br>
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes <br>
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow <br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow <br>
</p>

<p>
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
By becoming this all I want to do <br>
Is be more like me and be less like you <br>
</p>

<p>
Can't you see that you're smothering me? <br>
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control <br>
'Cause everything that you thought I would be <br>
Has fallen apart right in front of you <br>
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow <br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow <br>
And every second I waste is more than I can take! <br>
</p>

<p>
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
By becoming this all I want to do <br>
Is be more like me and be less like you <br>
</p>

<p>
And I know I may end up failing too <br>
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you <br>
</p>

<p>
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
By becoming this all I want to do <br>
Is be more like me and be less like you <br>
</p>

<p>
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
</p>
